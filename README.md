Hi, this is my example Next.js / Tailwind / Styled Components project demo.

I took this design from Figma, thanks for @Mohittdesigns. I codded this design with Next.js, Tailwind and Styled Components, and web site is full Responsive now.

Demo has only dark mode now but i'll add light mode.

Cheers, 
Can Altun.
