Hi, this is my front-end project demo which was created with Next.js / Tailwind / Styled Components.

I took this design from Figma, thanks for @Mohittdesigns. I codded this design with Next.js, Tailwind and Styled Components, and web site is full Responsive now.

* Demo has only dark mode now but i'll add light mode.
* I'll add mobile size navigation bar later.

Cheers, 
Can Altun.
